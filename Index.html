			<h2><center>Cpixel KitPvP Update!</center></h2>
			<p class="bold">I know a lot of you have been waiting for this update. Because KitPvP is the most popular Cpixel game so far, I decided to update it! This update adds 3 new kits that you can read more about in the changelog. It also adds the OP mode for Spleef that has said "Coming Soon" for a while now. I hope you all enjoy this update!</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3> Update Changelog: </h3>
			<ul>
			<p> 
				<li>Added 3 KitPvP kits: The Fisherman, The Raider, and The Ninja.</li>
				<li>Added OP mode for Spleef which gives you efficiency 100 golden shovels and snowballs.</li>
				<li>Added Ninja Stars, a powerful weapon only found in the Ninja kit but will later be added as a Lucky block drop. They do the damage of a pistol but can only be used once. They have unlimited range.</li>
				<li>Added the "Murderer" advancement for getting 500 kills.</li>
				<li>Added /spawn (the same as /hub or /lobby)</li>
				<li>Added /copycoords and /resetcopiedcoords. /copycoords copies your coordinates and displays them if you are in the chat or in a command block. /resetcopiedcoords will reset your copied coordinates and you wont see them in the chat or command block menu</li>
				<li>Added /regen, a feature that allows players to regen their health if they were spawn fighting or after a game.</li>
				<li>Added /hubaroo and /hubpvp. /hubaroo gives every player a knockback nemo. It is just a simple version of slaparoo that you can play in the hub. /hubpvp will give everyone armor and a sword so players can fight in the lobby instead of just punching eachother until they die.</li>
				<li>Added Airhorns! A feature I just added for fun that plays the annoying horn sound at a high volume when used. It is also a drop in Lucky Islands.</li>
				<li>General changes in Lucky Islands such as altering the height that the flying chickens spawn at and other stuff like that.</li>
